# SIS_Epidemic_Spreading_Simulation
Monte Carlo simulation of an epidemic using SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) model. Using complex networks (graphs), each node represents an individual that can either be infected (I) or susceptible (S) at any given time. Each edge between nodes represents a connection between two individuals, which means that they are in contact at each time step.
